# Let's Play tic-tac-toe!

###How To Play:

#### 1. Start the game by running the following code in the command line:
  `ruby game.rb`

#### 2. Select the game type
You will be prompted to select what type of game you would like to play. You should enter '1' for a human vs. computer game, '2' for a human vs. human game and '3' for a computer vs computer game.

#### 3. Enter player names
You will now be asked what each player will be called during game play. All players (including computers) can have a unique name.

#### 4. Enter player markers
Normally people will play with X's and O's, but you can choose whatever you want. The only restriction is that it must be one character long and it cannot be a number.

#### 5. Decide which player goes first
You now need to select which player will go first. Enter '1' or '2' to select which player will get the first move.

#### 6. Play the game!
During game play you will be provided with an image of the updated board, a message indicating what your opponent selected on their turn and a list of available options. To select which space you would like to chose, enter the number that corresponds to your chosen space. For computer vs computer games, a time-lag is added between rounds so you can see their strategies at work.
